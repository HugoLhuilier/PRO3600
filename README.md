# PRO3600
PRO3600 project at Télécom SudParis.

The goal of this project was to develop a language generation model capable of playing a role-playing game with the user.

The project's structure is pretty messy since I didn't know how to use git properly at that time. You can find one folder per week containing files needed at each steap of development. Thus the project cannot be launched directly from this repo ; anyway, feel free to explore the different files.
